If you are running on a computer/server, please paste the result of the `make doctor`
command from the cloned repo... And if you can't run `make doctor`,
please give us some info about your system (OS Version, Go version, etc)

If you are running on mobile, what's your version/branch? what's your device and OS?

Anything else you want to tell us, like your favorite cheese?
